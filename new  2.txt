where did you study?

its my school Chetana Vidyashram
it was renowned in area and the students usually get good grades at SLC
BUT
	I saw computer at class 10
	There ware labs but we never did any experiment with our own
	yes there were some extra curricular activities 
	we used to play games every Friday
	the learning was limited into class
	and there were no other resources than the book
		Experts call it a fact based education
	
the story is same for almost all of us k
	A study says more than 80% of total students are from such school
	YES more than 80% of peoplein this room are from such school
	We are fact based ... and we are never wrong unless the books we study is wrong 
	
There are other schools around having
	well equipped labs
	lots of extra activities 
	more interactive 
	
So our career ends up at NCELL NTC some NGO's or the government office 
	YES these are the best cases and we are happy with it 

Globally:
Lets look at some multinational and multi billion doller companies 
	where do they get their employee
	and why are not they in nepal 
	why are most of them concentrated around silicon valley
	Or  why the industrial revolution takes place at mmanchester 
	
Come down to education there 
	if larry page or mark jukurburg had not played with computers from their childhood what would had happened to google or facebook
	they were expensive schools may be 
	yes they will definately have more lots of facilities 
		its not just the AC attached on their class room its a study outsiide the class
		its not just well equipped labs in school its what they do with the reagents there 
	they adapt a different breed of education system : experts calls it a skilled based education
	
	
So we are filling this gap between my school and those schools from where those great innovators came from 

What are doing as karkhana ? < how can you trust me?>

	we are implimenting 5 dimensions of educationn to move foreward from conventional method of education to the mmaker education
		STEAM
		Science and Technology : obviously comes from west
		Engineering and mathematics : is all around the world
		Art : we ourself are rich on it 
		
		we : collect technological tools put in the engineering  and mathematics on it and promote local art and making culture through education 
			Sunny one of my friend who studied sciennce with me is now working at mahaguthi : mmahaguthi deals with the art, craft and making culture of nepal
			is there anny thing linked bbetween what he studied as studennt annd what is he doing right now ?
			obiviously yes we talk about STEAM.
			but it takes him 4 or 5 years of experience to link what he studied as student and what is he doing now 
			it would have been much better if he had got all those experiences beforehand
